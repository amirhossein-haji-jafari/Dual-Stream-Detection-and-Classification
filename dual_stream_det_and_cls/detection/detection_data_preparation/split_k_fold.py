This script prepares the dataset for 5-fold cross-validation.

1.  `create_k_folds_by_patient`: Splits all available images into 5 folds,
    ensuring that all images from a single patient belong to the same fold.
    This prevents data leakage between training and validation sets. It creates
    `fold_0.txt` through `fold_4.txt` in the `dataset_org` directory.

2.  `generate_per_fold_annotations`: For each fold `k`, this function creates two
    annotation files in the `dataset` directory:
    - `val_annotations_fold_k.txt`: Contains only the `_resized` images
      from the k-th fold, to be used for validation.
    - `train_annotations_fold_k.txt`: Contains all augmented images (excluding
      `_resized`) from the other four folds, to be used for training.
